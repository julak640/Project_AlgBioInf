The project code can be executed by running the jupyter notebook "Project.ipynb".
The script "project_annotate_peaks.R" is used to annotate the open chromatin regions with target genes.
The "project_exp_data.py" is used to format and normalize the gene expression data.
All inputs that are needed to run Project.ipynb are provided in "project_data/". Input data to "project_annotate_peaks.R" and "project_exp_data.py" is not provided, however the output is available in "project_data/".
